## Introduction

OpenCDx is a comprehensive platform designed for clinical data management, offering secure, scalable, and interoperable solutions across healthcare systems. The OpenCDx ecosystem includes several repositories that work together to streamline data management, enable clinical decision-making, and enhance user experiences.   
   
> **ðŸš€ Minimum Installation**
> 
> To get started, you only need the core **[OpenCDx Repository](https://github.com/opencdx/opencdx)**.

## Repositories Overview
The [OpenCDx Repository](https://github.com/opencdx/opencdx) forms the platform's backbone, providing core backend services, secure clinical data management, and interoperability. The [OpenCDx GUI](https://github.com/opencdx/opencdx-gui) repository enhances this core, adding an administrative dashboard for system configuration and management, along with a client-facing application to facilitate public user interaction. Data collected via **OpenCDx and OpenCDx-GUI** is stored and also extended to the [OpenCDx ADR](https://github.com/opencdx/ADR) repository. Stored data can then be easily queried using [OpenCDx ADR-gui](https://github.com/opencdx/ADR-gui). Additionally, the [OpenCDx UI Library](https://github.com/opencdx/ui-library) ensures visual consistency by providing reusable UI components across all platform interfaces.
