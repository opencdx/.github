## Introduction

OpenCDx is a comprehensive platform designed for **clinical data management**, offering secure, scalable, and interoperable solutions across healthcare systems. The OpenCDx ecosystem includes several repositories that work together to streamline data management, enable clinical decision-making, and enhance user experiences.   
   
> **ðŸš€ Minimum Installation**
> 
> To get started you need the core **[OpenCDx Repository](https://github.com/opencdx/opencdx)**.

[OpenCDx Repository](https://github.com/opencdx/opencdx) forms the platform's backbone, providing core backend services, secure clinical data management, and interoperability. The [OpenCDx GUI](https://github.com/opencdx/opencdx-gui) repository enhances this core, adding an administrative dashboard for system configuration and management, along with a client-facing application to facilitate public user interaction. Data collected via **OpenCDx** is stored and also extended to the [OpenCDx ADR](https://github.com/opencdx/ADR) repository. Stored data can then be easily queried using [OpenCDx ADR-gui](https://github.com/opencdx/ADR-gui). Additionally, the [OpenCDx UI Library](https://github.com/opencdx/ui-library) ensures visual consistency by providing reusable UI components across all platform interfaces.
